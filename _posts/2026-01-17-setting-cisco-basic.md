In this post I am going to go through the basic setup on a Cisco router to get the router working in a network.
Topics covered will be:
* Setting the hostname
* Setting up security
* Setting up IP's and connectivity

For all the topics in the CCNA we can either use Packet Tracer or physical kit. I will be using physical kit mostly as I have access to it.
