Hello and welcome to my docs site!
In here I am going to fill out my notes on:
* Networking - following the CCNA
* Security/Pentesting
* Linux
* Some homelab projects

I want to put down more than just how to do it, I want to explain why it is done this way for a deeper understanding of the topics covered.

This is being hosted on Github using Jekyll with the Chirpy theme
